A small website to showcase that I know basic html and css

# Info:<br/>
The mission statement for this project was to make a small website that acts similar to Craigslist, has lots of functionality, and tells a story. The aesthetics are a bit of a disaster but I hope that the page shows moreso that I know HOW to use css than that I know how to make good art
