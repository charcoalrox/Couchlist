            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                So I know this is a lot of text for one of these but there's a lot to go over with this chair and I want to make sure it's
                treated right at the next home. In a way, this sofa is a part of my family.
                This is a light gray Celsa sofa I got from my grandfather. I don't know the exact age of the thing but it has quite a few
                years under it's belt. No one it lived with has smoked although we do own a cat and two beautiful children so there are a 
                few scrapes and scratches from age. We're getting rid of it for sentimental reasons. My grandpa passed away last month
                and it's attached to too many memories that I find sad now. Bad for me but good for you because I've taken great care of it.
            </p>
            <h3>Fun little quirks and how to combat them</h3>
            <p>
                Along with age comes extra work here and there for the owners of a product and this couch has done it's fair share of aging.
                Nothing major but I suppose it's nice stuff to know. First and foremost, the legs aren't perfectly level. It isn't by a lot
                but if you're putting the sofa in a room without carpet it's gonna tumble a little when you sit (and also maybe creak). There's 
                also a little hole under the right-most cushion that loves eating spare change and cell phones (so save that side for guests). 
                A new issue I just started noticing 3 or 4 weeks ago is that the sofa seems to make creaking noises late at night? My theory is
                it's just settling due to old age but I didn't know couches could do that. It never seems to happen when someone is in the room
                with the couch so I guess my tip to combat this one is to pick up a nice guard dog with your nice new couch (though our cat seems 
                to flip out around the thing these days).
            </p>
            <h3>Some items we recommend you keep by the couch</h3>
            <p>
                I like to thing we've had this couch long enough to know what looks really good with it so I'm just gonna toss some stuff out there
                that you may want to keep around, just to keep things nice. I would suggest some nice reading material (like a bible), a few candles
                (about 2 should work. I find black with a sage scent work best), and a bit of salt in a nearby drawer couldn't hurt. 
            </p>
